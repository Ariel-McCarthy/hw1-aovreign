                An extremely important aspect of computer science is programming! <br/>
                <p>
                    Before someone begins to program, they must first decide which programming language to choose.<br/>
                    Here you can find information to help you choose the right language for you,<br/> 
                    depending on which type of outcome you'd like.<br/><br/>
                    For example: Will you want to create a project?<br/> 
                    Maybe you want graphics, maybe you want to program a robot, or you might want to follow weather patterns.<br/><br/>
                    Simply navigate through the links in order to find the best language(s) for the work you want to produce.
                </p>
